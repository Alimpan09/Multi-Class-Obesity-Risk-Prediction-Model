# Multi-Class-Obesity-Risk-Prediction-Model
Using Various Machine Learning Model, I have made a multi-class obesity Prediction Model to Predict the obesity with more than 93% accuracy.


# Dataset Description
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Obesity or CVD risk dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

Note: This dataset is particularly well suited for visualizations, clustering, and general EDA. Show off your skills!
